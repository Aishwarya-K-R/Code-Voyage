*****Text Detect : Building an OCR Recognition System*****

Overview of the Project : 
This project is aimed at developing a recognition system that recognizes the text and license plates from the images using the Python tools such as EasyOCR and Pytesseract.
This project also involves developing a machine learning model using Neural Networks and the IAM words dataset that is capable of recognizing the handwritten text from the handwriting images.


Requirements of the project :
1. Virtual Environment
2. Python version - 3.11 
3. Tensorflow version - 2.15.0   
4. Numpy version for EasyOCR - 1.24.4
5. OpenCV and Matplotlib version for Numpy - 1.23.0
6. IDE - Visual Studio Code


Steps for the implementation :
1. Download the source code of the project.
2. The trained model is also avilable inside the project folder.
3. Run frontend.py file to view the output.
