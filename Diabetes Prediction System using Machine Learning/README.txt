*****Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning*****

Overview of the Project :
This project aims to create an accurate classification model which predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not using various measures.
It is implemented using various machine learning concepts and algorithms and many built-in libraries and modules in Python which are specifically designed for the use in machine learning.
The diabetes prediction is done by using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset with medical predictor variables such as the number of pregnancies, with an aim of assisting in early diabetes diagnosis and risk assessment, ultimately improving patient care and health outcomes.
The machine learning model is trained on this dataset and predictions are made for user entered test set.

User Interface :
This project also aims at attracting the users with its catchy interfacing.
Users are asked to enter various medical parameters for which the Diabetes Prediction needs to be done.

Output:
It outputs :
1. True - If a patient has Diabetes.
2. False - If a patient has Diabetes.

Steps for Implementation :
1. Download the Source Code of the project.
2. Download the dataset and paste it in a required folder.
3. Download the Jupyter Notebook.
4. Replace the path of the dataset with the path of the dataset folder and run the Notebook code provided above.
5. Run the Python code and HTML code in any IDE - Visual Studio Code / PyCharm, etc, to view the output.
